Designed and developed by Demi Hu using Adobe Illustrator and Godot 4.

### About the concept
Executive dysfunction is a behavioral symptom of ADHD and other mental disorders characterized by the inability to perform any of the three basic executive functions:
- Working memory
  - Short-term memory--whatever you are doing right now
- Cognitive flexibility
  - How well your brain can shift and move from one topic to another
- Inhibition control
  - Your ability to steer or manage your thoughts, emotions and actions in order to not focus on or do things you shouldn't
  
Executive dysfunction can make planning and going about your day feel like a game of chance. Plinko Planner aims to simulate that experience by introducing challenge and unpredictability in your attempts to be productive. People with ADHD are often unfairly seen as scatterbrained or lazy, an outdated stereotype that ignores the real difficulty of executive dysfunction.
